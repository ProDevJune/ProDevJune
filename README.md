## ðŸš€ About the Theme

This project is based on the [**Chirpy**](https://github.com/cotes2020/jekyll-theme-chirpy) Jekyll theme.  
It includes extended features from [Minimal Mistakes](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/) for tag/category support.

To unlock all of Chirpyâ€™s features, this project contains critical components copied from the gem-based theme into the local repo:

```shell
.
â”œâ”€â”€ _config.yml
â”œâ”€â”€ _plugins
â”œâ”€â”€ _tabs
â””â”€â”€ index.html
